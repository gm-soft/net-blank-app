# I am a newbie in .NET, what should I do

If you are a newcomer in .net backend development, you should do a several easy steps:

1. You have to read what is .NET and .NET Core in [the official guide by MS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/).
2. You have to read [Get started with C# and Visual Studio Code](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tutorials/with-visual-studio-code).
3. You have to read [Tutorial: Create your first .NET Core console application in Visual Studio 2019](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tutorials/with-visual-studio?tabs=csharp)
4. You have to read a full tutorial [Полное руководство по языку программирования С# 8.0 и платформе .NET Core 3](https://metanit.com/sharp/tutorial/). Even this material is in Russian, it is really good and concise.

If you have a background in other programming languages, going deep in .NET would not take much time from you. If you have red the materials and still have questions, feel free to ask the question to maintainers of this repository.
